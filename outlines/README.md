# Lecture Outlines

Lecture outlines will be posted before each class.
The lecture outlines will only be outlines, so they'll contain the headings of what I plan on talking about.
Sometimes, though, I have to make changes to my plans during lecture.
In addition, I'm not always sure how far I'll get in each lecture.
Thus, we may skip around on the outlines, introduce topics that aren't on the outline, or not get all the way through the outline.
That being said, I'll try my best to stick to what's on each outline.

See the [schedule](https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs154a-ssii18/blob/master/syllabus/schedule.csv) for what each set of lecture outlines corresponds to.
